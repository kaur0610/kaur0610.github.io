#Project title
I have developed my photography portfolio website. It is a self-branding website. I have used a combination of family-owned pictures sourced by professional photographer and self-clicked pictures to have a clear and concise layout. The website has four pages to visit- homepage, about, portfolio and contact page.
#Motivation
I got the inspiration to develop a photography website when I was asked to create a concept and shoot images for a photography assignment. I chose the theme of the website based on my concept images and took a few family-owned pictures to create an aesthetically appealing website.
#Code style
A combination of html, bootstrap framework and css for custom changes.
#Features
-The colour scheme shows feminism and white space for a minimalistic design
-A serif italic font to grab attention and followed by sans-serif for body-text
